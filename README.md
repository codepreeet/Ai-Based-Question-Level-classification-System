# Ai-Based-Question-Level-classification-System
This project implements an automated system for classifying the difficulty level and Bloom's Taxonomy level of exam questions using a traditional NLP approach. A dataset of over 1000 unique questions across Math, GK, Programming, and Computer Science was curated and preprocessed. Each question is converted to a TF-IDF vector and classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The system achieves high accuracy, demonstrating that classical NLP models remain robust for small to medium datasets. This work supports automated question bank tagging, mock test systems, and intelligent tutoring.
